# RealShuffle for Spotify

In my experience, Spotify's shuffle isn't so great. It seems to only select and play
a part of an album or playlist when using it. This little tool automatically shuffles a 
Spotify playlist for you so you can just hit play and get an actually shuffled playlist.

I wrote this all in one day on a time crunch so the code is full of smells. It isn't idiot 
proof yet either. I'll clean it up on request.

## Builds

Coming soon

## Roadmap (I guess?)

Clean up and refactor

Idiot proof

Any other features?
